# pythonChess
a very simple python chess engine completely written from scratch,
It can evaluate all possible moves in a standard position and can find capture opportunities,
There is no support for calculating multiple moves in the future of the game nor does it have special moves like en-passant or castling.
Those features may be added soon,
**STILL IN DEVELOPMENT**
