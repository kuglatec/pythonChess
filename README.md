# pythonChess
# a very simple python chess engine completely written from scratch,
# It can evaluate all possible moves in any position and can find capture opportunities.
# There is no support for calculating multiple moves in the future of the game nor does it have special moves like en-passant or castling.
# **Those features may be added soon.**
**STILL IN DEVELOPMENT**
